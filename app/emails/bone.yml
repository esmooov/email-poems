  Dear Erik,


  She has it like a bone hook, 

  dipping it into an ocean. Polished and white.


  During the last month of the year, you spoke of your vision for happiness. Your vision has no working ladder. 


  On the second day of the fifth month, I fell asleep on the couch for a moment. I had just finished a chapter of my book; it was open like a bird on my stomach.


  On the first day of the eighth month, and now I do mean for this to sound reasonable, I realized that the decision for it was always yours and never mine for some reason. 


  Today, I felt perfect satisfaction.


  Yesterday was a sad day.



  This is how it happened. I’m sorry the whole letter is taken up with it. Please remember that most things are invisible.




  Splash some water on your cheeks,


  Josi
