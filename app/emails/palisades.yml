  Dear Erik,


  If I keep repeating the same remarks, forgive me– not to suggest a hymn so messy or fragile, simply because it now seems important to have a chance at having a chance, which can only be expressed through a letter.



  The whole island-city is leaning heavily to one side and turning over slowly. You told me you’d rather I not think about it so much. “It’s not so straightforward”. You took the train home. I write you. I’m writing you. Daily. 


  Tell me about your sleep and follies. Who is around these days? What dogmas needle you? Why do I write to you today? Well, I had time (probably a lot of time). Twenty years? And I'm happy to know you. When you are away, I miss you. One does instinctively visit the ruins.


  I think he notices everything about me. I don't mean to be ridiculous, but it is true that everything he speaks to me has a hundred secret meanings. It’s very exhausting. When I do return empty and wordless, what will you do then? Will you come back for a copy? Will you come back for a copy?  The ocean is not only living completely; it is also playing tricks on us.


  All my love letters end the same. Like this.




  Entreaties, Oaths, Apologies,


  Josi
